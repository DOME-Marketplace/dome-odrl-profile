## Abstract

## Prologue

### How to read dome-odrl-profile

In this piont of time (2024-02) `dome-odrl-profile` is very fuzzy and buggy - why?

Even we can see some ODRL-Policies, started on use cases coming from DOME-Replication, used identifier (for parties, individuals, organizations, product-offerings, catalogues) and glued properties are some kind of *under-specified*, even they look proper and correctly aligned to given schema  or data-models... So, we have don't have to read it as an up-and-running solution.

### ODRL-Profile

Saying so, to define an ODRL-Profile, included Policies, Rules, Operands, nested in Constraints, we have to be more precise and focus on schemes and data-models - in the end of the story an ODRL-Evaluator (Policy Decision Point, **PDP**) will be implemented and this implementation has to have a good definition-basis: `dome-odrl-profile`...

### Requirements

`dome-odrl-profile` needs requirements, use cases, etc., as we can see it in Replication-portion. Replication seems to be a good starter for me (jlangkau), because we can see some sort of Access Control, too. So this use case is a good starter to solve common "DOME-Access-Control-Problems", hopefully...

### Issues

Please make issues, so we can discuss and make `dome-odrl-profile` a little bit better.
