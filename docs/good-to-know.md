# Good to Know

## Resource Description Framework

> RDF is a standard model for data interchange on the Web.
> RDF has features that facilitate data merging even if the underlying schemas differ,
> and it specifically supports the evolution of schemas over time
> without requiring all the data consumers to be changed.
>
> - <https://www.w3.org/RDF/>

> The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
> standard originally designed as a data model for metadata.
> It has come to be used as a general method for description and exchange of graph data.
> RDF provides a variety of syntax notations and data serialization formats,
> with Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) currently being the most widely used notation.

## Turtle Format

- **MIME-Type:** `text/turtle`
- **File-Extension:** `.ttl`

> Turtle allows an RDF graph to be completely written in a compact and natural text form,
> with abbreviations for common usage patterns and datatypes.
> Turtle provides levels of compatibility with the N-Triples format
> as well as the triple pattern syntax of the SPARQL W3C Recommendation.
>
> - <https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/>

> In computing, Terse RDF Triple Language (Turtle) is a syntax and file format
> for expressing data in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model.
> Turtle syntax is similar to that of SPARQL, an RDF query language.
> It is a common data format for storing RDF data, along with N-Triples,
> JSON-LD and RDF/XML.

## JSON-LD Format

- **MIME-Type:** `application/ld+json`
- **File-Extension:** `.jsonld`

> JSON-LD is a lightweight Linked Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write.
> It is based on the already successful JSON format and provides a way
> to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale. JSON-LD is an ideal data format
> for programming environments, REST Web services, and unstructured databases
> such as Apache CouchDB and MongoDB.
>
> - <https://json-ld.org/>

> JSON is a useful data serialization and messaging format.
> The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems that already use JSON,
> and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD.
> It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments,
> to build interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines.
>

## Rights Expression Language

> A Rights Expression Language or REL is a machine-processable language used to express
> intellectual property rights (such as copyright) and other terms and conditions
> for use over content. RELs can be used as standalone expressions
> (i.e. metadata usable for search, compatibility tracking) or within a DRM system.
>
> - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_Expression_Language>

## Open Digital Rights Language

- **Abbreviation:** `ODRL`

> The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language
> that provides a flexible and interoperable information model,
> vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements
> about the usage of content and services.
>
> - <https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/>
> - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODRL>

## eXtensible Access Control Markup Language

- **Abbreviation:** `XACML`

> The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) is an XML-based
> standard markup language for specifying access control policies.
> The standard, published by OASIS, defines a declarative fine-grained,
> attribute-based access control policy language, an architecture,
> and a processing model describing how to evaluate access requests
> according to the rules defined in policies.
