  "description": "An Action class indicates an operation that can be exercised on an Asset. An Action is associated with the Asset via the action property in a Rule. The Rule provides the specific interpretations of the Action. For example; an Action is permitted to be exercised on the target Asset when related to a Permission. When related to a Prohibition, the Action indicates the operation that is prohibited to be exercised on the target Asset. When related to a Duty, the Action indicates the agreed operation that is obligatory to be fulfilled by a Party.",
