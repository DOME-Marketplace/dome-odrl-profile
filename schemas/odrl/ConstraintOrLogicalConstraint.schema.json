  "description": "Constraints are boolean/logical expressions that can be used to refine the semantics of an Action and Party/Asset Collection or declare the conditions applicable to a Rule. Constraints can be represented as a Constraint class or Logical Constraint class. A Logical Constraint will refer to existing Constraints as its operands. When multiple Constraints apply to the same Rule, Action, Party/Asset Collection, then they are interpreted as conjunction and all MUST be satisfied.",
